c DFA is 5-tuple
c states,start state,alphabet,accept state(s),transition function
c enter here everything except the alphabet, alphabet for DFA by default is (0,1). NO need to define here
c e=empty string to test
c --> THIS DFA accepts all binary strings where 0s and 1s alternate, pg7 example 1.5(botton) <--
