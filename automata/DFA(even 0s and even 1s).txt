c DFA is 5-tuple
c states,start state,alphabet,accept state(s),transition function
c enter here everything except the alphabet, alphabet for DFA by default is (0,1). NO need to define here
c e=empty string to test
c --> THIS DFA accepts all binary strings with even 0s and even 1s, pg 11 exercise 1.19 <--
