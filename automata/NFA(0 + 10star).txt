c NFA is 5-tuple
c states,start state,alphabet,accept state(s),transition function
c enter here everything except the alphabet, alphabet for NFA by default is (0,1). NO need to define here.
c e=ebsilon transition; also acts like an alphabet. Only put transitions for states that have any
c --> THIS NFA IS FOR:  0 + 10* , nfa shown on pg26 example 3.6 (just label the states) <--
