c NFA is 5-tuple
c states,start state,alphabet,accept state(s),transition function
c enter here everything except the alphabet, alphabet for NFA by default is (0,1). NO need to define here.
c e=ebsilon transition; also acts like an alphabet. Only put transitions for states that have any
c --> THIS NFA IS FOR the RE:  0*+(01)* , nfa shown on pg23 example 3.5 (binary except of letters) <--
